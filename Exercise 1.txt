    Create a class Animal that has a method makeSound(). 
Exercise 1:
 
    Then create two subclasses of Animal class: Horse and Cat that extends Animal class and 
     provide their specific implementation of makeSound() method.
 
  Sample Output:
     The animal makes a sound
     The Horse says: wee wee
     The Cat says: meow meow



//Add Animal class and Create makeSound() method 

//Add Horse class that extends Animal class

//Add Cat class that extends Animal class

class  AnimalInheritance:
 


//Create all 3 Animal objects and add to an List

//Loop over the List and print sound it makes
